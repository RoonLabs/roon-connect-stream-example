Roon Connect Stream Example
==

Running this sample:

```js
npm install
node ./test.mjs
```

Then to get it going:

1. Open Roon
2. In Roon, go to Settings > Extensions
3. This extension should be listed. Enable it by hitting the Enable button next to the "Roon Connect Stream Example".
4. Hit the Settings button (it's where the Enable button used to be located), and select the audio output you want this example to stream to.
5. Go back to Home in Roon make sure Roon has that audio output selected in the bottom bar. This will be useful later on.

Now, back in the console where you ran this sample:

1. Hit enter a few times and make sure you see the prompt.
2. You can type `play http://strm112.1.fm/dubstep_mobile_mp3` and hit enter. It will take a few seconds to start streaming/buffering, but you should hear Roon playing this stream and see your brand taking over the bottom bar.
